# PopularMoviesStage2
This app displays the list of movies in sorted order based on user's selection. Also one can choose the item as favorite
so that he/she will be able to see the items saved as favorite rather than having to scroll and search for the item everytime.

How to run the app:

To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from themoviedb.org.

If you donâ€™t already have an account
------------------------------------
You will need to create an account on themoviedb account site in order to request an API Key.
In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for educational/non-commercial use. You will
also need to provide some personal information to complete the request.
Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.

If you already have an api key and forgot what it is
----------------------------------------------------

You can find the same under Account settings -> API section

Please put the same value under gradle.properties MovieDbAPIKey field => API_KEY value to run the app error-free.
